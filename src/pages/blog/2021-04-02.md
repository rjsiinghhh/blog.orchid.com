Multi-chain compatibility is now available on the Orchid network -- a major step toward the Orchid community's  goal of making Internet privacy affordable and accessible to everyone in the world. The network now accepts any compatible chain's base currency -- allowing for lower network fees that will let people set up smaller accounts. For example, upgraded nanopayments on xDAI allow Orchid users to start using the service for as little as $1.

People can now set up an Orchid account and purchase bandwidth on any one of the following six blockchains:

-   [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) 

-   [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/) 

-   [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) 

-   [RSK Blockchain](https://www.rsk.co/rsk-blockchain/) 

-   [Matic](https://matic.network/) 

-   [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain)

[Probabilistic nanopayments](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f) are a layer-two solution by which tiny amounts of money can be sent as off-chain probabilities. When users pay VPN providers for service, payment is sent in the form of nanopayments, each of which is worth approximately one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a penny and is paid based on the service provided. This system allows users to access a unique pay-as-you-go model for the Orchid network's VPN service, with no fixed fee or recurring subscription for users.

With multi-chain compatibility, people can now obtain VPN service on the Orchid network with any of the six chains listed above. Users can set up accounts on any of these blockchains by installing an appropriate wallet, acquiring funds, and using the Orchid dApp at account.orchid.com. The ability to use sidechains in this way allows users to choose the option that is best for them as they seek out low gas fees or other attractive qualities.\
Multi-chain support will drastically expand payment options for access to Orchid's VPN marketplace, making it easier for many more people around the world to surf the Internet with the benefit of [multiple hops](https://blog.orchid.com/what-is-a-hop/) and ample bandwidth. With a starting price as low as $1, multi-chain compatibility makes Orchid the lowest-cost open-source VPN service currently available.
