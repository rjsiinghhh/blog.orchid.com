Multi-chain compatibility is now available on the Orchid network -- a major step toward the Orchid community's  goal of making Internet privacy affordable and accessible to everyone in the world. The network now accepts any compatible chain's base currency -- allowing for lower network fees that will let people set up smaller accounts. For example, upgraded nanopayments on xDAI allow Orchid users to start using the service for as little as $1.

People can now set up an Orchid account and purchase bandwidth on any one of the following six blockchains:

-   [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) 

-   [xDai](https://www.xdaichain.com/) 

-   [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/) 

-   [RSK Blockchain](https://www.rsk.co/rsk-blockchain/) 

-   [Matic](https://matic.network/) 

-   [Binance Smart Chain](https://www.binance.org/en/smartChain)

[Probabilistic nanopayments](https://medium.com/orchid-labs/probabilistic-nanopayments-4aa423c3f22f) are a layer-two solution by which tiny amounts of money can be sent as off-chain probabilities. When users pay VPN providers for service, payment is sent in the form of nanopayments, each of which is worth approximately one-thousandth (1/1,000) of a penny and is paid based on the service provided. This system allows users to access a unique pay-as-you-go model for the Orchid network's VPN service, with no fixed fee or recurring subscription for users.

With multi-chain compatibility, people can now obtain VPN service on the Orchid network with any of the six chains listed above. Users can set up accounts on any of these blockchains by installing an appropriate wallet, acquiring funds, and using the Orchid dApp at account.orchid.com. The ability to use sidechains in this way allows users to choose the option that is best for them as they seek out low gas fees or other attractive qualities.

Multi-chain support will drastically expand payment options for access to Orchid's VPN marketplace, making it easier for many more people around the world to surf the Internet with the benefit of [multiple hops](https://blog.orchid.com/what-is-a-hop/) and ample bandwidth. With a starting price as low as $1, multi-chain compatibility makes Orchid the lowest-cost open-source VPN service currently available.

A long-term solution for high gas fees

Increased affordability is particularly important given the pressure Ethereum faces from high gas fees, which have emerged as a challenge to projects throughout the ecosystem. With over $70 billion now locked in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, prices are likely to remain elevated for the foreseeable future. And as network fees increase on a given chain, Orchid accounts require a higher amount of funds in the balance and deposit. Identifying a solution that ensures people are not priced out due to gas fees is therefore a central focus for the Orchid community -- particularly for the Orchid network's global users for whom high cost has the potential to be prohibitive.

Multi-chain compatibility gives users an alternative to high gas prices on Ethereum by allowing them to pay for service on other chains. Designing the system for multiple chains allows users and providers options to find lower transaction fees, and represents a long-term solution to help provide the most competitive pricing to users everywhere.

Orchid's native digital asset, the [ERC-20 OXT](https://www.orchid.com/oxt), is used to secure the network of providers and is still the only currency used for staking. Providers must stake OXT to be eligible to offer bandwidth, and are awarded business at a rate proportional to the amount staked.  The more bandwidth that is purchased by users on the Orchid network, the more incentive that node providers have to stake OXT in order to sell bandwidth and meet the demand. Newly supported chains on the Orchid network serve to remove significant cost barriers for users to purchase bandwidth.

Orchid is an Ethereum project; our community is part of the Ethereum community, and the Orchid community is as committed as ever to its success. The recent rise in gas prices is a symptom of the Ethereum network's continued momentum -- an undeniably positive macro trend. But since greater usage of the Ethereum network  means greater competition to do transactions, this growth has introduced a new, crucial challenge for Ethereum. It is a challenge to which Ethereum users and developers  across the ecosystem have worked hard to find a solution.

Making privacy possible for everyone

Ethereum is at an important inflection point in its evolution, as increased demand continues to put upward pressure on gas fees. The long-term solution for this issue is to extend support to any EVM-compatible chain in order to enable people to use the Orchid network for as little as $1. Multi-chain compatibility brings the Orchid network one step closer to making online privacy available to everyone, everywhere.
